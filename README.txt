To run the provided Python program, you need the following requirements:

1.Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. The program is written in Python 3, so ensure you have a compatible version installed. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.Pygame Library: The program uses the Pygame library for game development. Pygame is not a standard library in Python, so you need to install it separately. You can install Pygame using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


pip install pygame


1.Image and Asset Files: The program uses image files for the game elements such as the background, ball, obstacle, and game over screen. Make sure you have the image files placed in the same directory as the Python script, or provide the correct file paths in the pygame.image.load() function calls for each image. 

The required image files are:

Background.jpg: The background image.
Boy.png: The obstacle image.
Ball.png: The ball image.
Game over.png: The game over image.
Ensure all the image files mentioned above are present and correctly named.

Once you have Python, Pygame, and the required image files set up, you can run the Python script, and it should open a window displaying the "Jumping Ball" game. You can interact with the game by pressing the SPACE key to make the ball jump and avoid collisions with the moving obstacles. You can restart the game by pressing the R key after a game over or quit the game by pressing the Q key.
